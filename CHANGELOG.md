## Description

This is a Jenkins Plugin to do security vulnerabilities scan on registries and local images with NeuVector Scanner.

## Notes

* It supports two scan modes. The first is "Controller & Scanner" mode. The second is the standalone scanner mode. You can select the scan mode in the project configuration page. By default, it uses the "Controller & Scanner" mode.

## Requirements
* For the "Controller & Scanner" mode, you need to install the NeuVector controller and scanner in the network. To scan the local image (the image on the Jenkins machine), the "Controller & Scanner" needs to be installed on the same node where the image exists.

* For the standalone mode, Docker must be installed on the same host with Jenkins. Also, add *jenkins* user to the *docker* group.

     ```
     sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
     ```
* If run the Jenkins as a container, you need to create the directory "/var/jenkins_home" on the host machine. To start the Jenkins container with the below code:

    ```
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(which docker):$(which docker) --name=jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
    ```

## Setup the configuration in Jenkins

1. After installed the plugin, you will find the ‘NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner’ section in the global configuration page (Jenkins ‘Configure System’). Enter values for the "Controller & Scanner" mode which includes NeuVector Scanner source name, controller IP, port, username, and password. You may click the ‘Test Connection’ button to validate the values. It will show ‘Connection Success’ or an error message.

   The timeout minutes value will terminate the build step within the time entered. The default value of 0 means no timeout will occur.

   Enter values for the standalone scanner mode which includes NeuVector Scanner Registry URL, NeuVector Scanner Image Repository, NeuVector Scanner Registry User, NeuVector Scanner Registry Password, NeuVector License.

   Click the ‘Add Registry’ to enter values for the registry you will use in your project. If you just want to scan local images, you don’t need to add a registry here.

2. In your project configuration page, choose the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' plugin from the drop down menu in the 'Add build step'. Firstly, check the checkbox "Scan with Standalone scanner" if you want to do the scan in the standalone scanner mode. By default, it uses "Controller & Scanner" mode to do the scan. Secondly, choose 'Local' for local image scan. To do a registry scan, you need to define the registry in the global config page and choose the registry name here. Enter the repository (image) name and tag name. You may choose Jenkins default environment variables for the repository or tag. e.g. $JOB_NAME, $BUILD_TAG, $BUILD_NUMBER. Enter the values for the number of high or medium, the vulnerability names that present to fail the build, the vulnerability names that are exempt from the scan.

   When the build finishes, a NeuVector report will be generated. The report shows the scan details and errors if any.
